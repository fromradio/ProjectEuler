My code for Project Euler
==========
Project Euler is a great project aiming at solving mathematical problems using computer programming.
In this repository I publish my code for the problems written in C++ and Python.

## [Introduction]

There are over 500 interesting problems on 'Project Euler' website.
And I am pretty new for the website.
However, I want to encourage myself to solve these problems and write more C++ codes in the process.
I know that Haskell, Scala or Python might be better choices but I still try to write C++11 code.
Some problems are solved via Python.
